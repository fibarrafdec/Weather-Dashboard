GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs,
WHEN I search for a city,
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history,
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city,
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed,
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city,
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity,
